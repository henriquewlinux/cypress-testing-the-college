# Test automation in Cypress - The College Store

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

This test automation in cypress was made in TypeScript.

---

## Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v22.2.0` of Node.js and npm `10.7.0`, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

---

## Installation
Run `npm install` (or npm i for the short version) to install the dependencies.

---

### Execute tests

Run `npm cy:run` to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run `npm cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.
